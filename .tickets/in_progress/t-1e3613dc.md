    This ticket should enhance the list command to support glob patterns for filtering tickets by state. The implementation should:
    1. Add a new --glob or --pattern option to the list command
    2. Support common patterns like **/.tickets/**/*.md (all tickets)
    3. Support state-specific patterns like **/.tickets/open/*.md
    4. Work with the existing ticket directory structure
    5. Be backwards compatible with current list functionality---
