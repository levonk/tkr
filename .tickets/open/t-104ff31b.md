# Fix migrate command - tickets not being moved to proper state directories


## Notes

**2026-02-04 02:29:31**: BUG: tkr migrate command reports success but doesn't actually migrate tickets.

Issue: When running 'tkr migrate', the command reports 'Migration completed successfully from bash-tk' and 'Migrated 0 tickets from bash tk format', but the existing ticket files in .tickets/ directory are not being recognized by 'tkr list'.

Expected behavior: 
- migrate should detect existing tickets in subdirectories (open/, closed/, in_progress/, etc.)
- move them to the proper tkr structure if needed
- make them visible to 'tkr list'

Actual behavior:
- Tickets remain in their original directories
- 'tkr list' shows 'No tickets found'
- 'ls .tickets/' shows tickets exist in archive/, in_progress/, blocked/, closed/, icebox/, open/, ready/ directories

Root cause appears to be that the migrate command is not properly processing the existing ticket structure or the tickets are already in the correct format but not being detected by the listing functionality.
