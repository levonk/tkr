# Add VS Code integration for opening tickets from IDE links

## User Story
As a developer using VS Code, I want to click on ticket links (like `t-e57785c`) in my IDE and have them open directly in my AI chat window with the ticket content loaded and cursor positioned in the description field, so I can quickly reference and work on tickets without leaving my development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Create a VS Code extension or command that can open tkr tickets from ticket ID links
- [ ] When clicking a ticket ID (e.g., `t-e57785c`) in VS Code, the ticket opens in the AI chat window
- [ ] Ticket content should be displayed in standard output format
- [ ] Cursor should be automatically positioned in the description field for easy editing

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Support for ticket ID format: `t-{id}` (e.g., `t-e57785c`)
- [ ] Works with VS Code's link detection and clickable text
- [ ] Integrates with existing AI chat window functionality
- [ ] Maintains tkr's markdown format and structure

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Leverage VS Code's `vscode.open` command or similar API
- [ ] Parse ticket ID from clicked text/link
- [ ] Read ticket file from `.tickets/` directory
- [ ] Format ticket content for AI chat window display
- [ ] Handle cursor positioning in description field

### Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling of non-existent ticket IDs
- [ ] Clear error messages when tickets can't be found
- [ ] Fallback behavior for malformed ticket IDs

## Technical Notes

### Possible Implementation Approaches

1. **VS Code Extension**: Create a lightweight extension that registers a link provider
2. **VS Code Tasks/Commands**: Use VS Code's task system to create custom commands
3. **Terminal Integration**: Leverage terminal commands with VS Code's integrated terminal

### File Locations
- Ticket files: `.tickets/{status}/t-{id}.md`
- Extension logic: Could be added to existing VS Code configuration or as separate extension

### Integration Points
- VS Code's `vscode.open` command for opening files
- Link detection patterns for ticket IDs
- AI chat window API for content insertion

## Dependencies
- tkr CLI tool must be available in the environment
- VS Code extension development environment (if creating extension)
- AI chat window API access

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can click ticket IDs in VS Code and see tickets open in AI chat
- [ ] Cursor positioning works correctly in description field
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage instructions
- [ ] Testing confirms functionality across different ticket formats

## Notes
This feature should enhance the developer workflow by reducing context switching between the IDE and ticket management system. The integration should feel seamless and native to VS Code's user experience.
