# Enable cargo install from repository

Configure Cargo.toml and repository structure to support direct cargo install

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Update Cargo.toml Configuration
- Ensure proper `name` field in `[package]` section
- Add appropriate `categories` and `keywords` for discoverability
- Verify `license` field is correctly set
- Add `repository` and `homepage` fields
- Include `readme` field pointing to README.md
- Set appropriate `version` (semver)

### 2. Binary Configuration
- Verify `[[bin]]` section exists with correct binary name
- Ensure binary name is appropriate (`tkr` not `tk`)
- Check `path` points to correct source file

### 3. Repository Structure Validation
- Ensure `src/main.rs` exists and is properly structured
- Verify `Cargo.toml` is in repository root
- Check that all dependencies are properly specified

### 4. Testing cargo install
- Test installation from git repository:
  ```bash
  cargo install --git https://github.com/username/tkr
  ```
- Test installation from local path:
  ```bash
  cargo install --path .
  ```
- Verify binary is available in PATH after installation

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Update README.md with installation instructions
- Add cargo install badge to README
- Update AGENTS.md with installation information
- Document installation methods in both files

## Implementation Steps
1. Review and update Cargo.toml configuration
2. Test local cargo install --path .
3. Test remote cargo install from git repository
4. Update documentation with installation instructions
5. Verify installation works correctly

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `cargo install --path .` works successfully
- [ ] `cargo install --git <repo-url>` works successfully
- [ ] Binary installs with correct name (`tkr`)
- [ ] Binary is functional after installation
- [ ] README.md includes clear cargo install instructions
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents installation process
- [ ] Installation tested on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS)

## Notes
This will make the tool easily installable for users without requiring them to clone and build manually. It's a standard Rust ecosystem practice that improves user experience significantly.
